# Overview

Roomier is a platform designed to connect you with your next roommate. Sign up for an account and begin creating posts to advertise your current or future housing accommodations, or browse the number of open requests for roommates from other users like you. If you find something you like, apply directly in app and other users will be sent your name, email and which location post you're applying to. It's as simple as that!

# Getting started

```

2. To run the application, run commands:

```sh

```

# Future Work

The `production` deployment of this repo is hosted [here](https://roomier.onrender.com) and `development` can be accessed [here](https://roomier-dev.onrender.com).

Currently, the team is hard at work on updating the user interface and including a search functionality for existing posts. We're experimenting with visualizing useful key metrics to help end users make informative decisions. We're also doing research on connecting different user social profiles like Instagram, Facebook, etc. for a more open social experience.
